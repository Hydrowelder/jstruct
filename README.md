# jstruct

`jstruct` is a Java package to add simple serialization and deserialization to Java. It works in a way similar to the fantastic [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) Python package.

It currently only supports serialization and deserialization of select types. Full disclosure, I wrote this in a morning a day after starting to learn Java, so its more of a fun project than production ready.

See the example for usage.
